    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

### **Project Overview**  
The **Plant Disease Recognition System** is an AI-powered application designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Using **deep learning** techniques, our model accurately identifies diseases, helping farmers and researchers take timely action to protect crops and improve agricultural sustainability.  

### **Flow Of System**  
1. Users upload an image of a plant leaf suspected of having a disease.  
2. The system processes the image using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of diseased and healthy leaves.  
3. The model predicts the disease category and provides a result.  

### **Dataset Information**  
Our model is trained on an extensive dataset containing images of healthy and diseased plant leaves:  
- **Training Set:** 70,295 images  
- **Validation Set:** 17,572 images  
- **Test Set:** 33 images  
The dataset includes **38 different plant disease classes**, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.  

### **Technologies Used**  
üîπ **Programming Language:** Python  
üîπ **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras  
üîπ **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Streamlit  
üîπ **Model Architecture:** Deep Learning (CNN)  
üîπ **Deployment:** Web-based (Streamlit)  

### **Our Mission**  
üåø To empower farmers and agricultural experts with AI-based disease detection.  
‚ö° To enhance crop protection by enabling early disease identification.  
üìä To provide an accessible, efficient, and accurate plant disease recognition tool.  

For more details, explore the **Disease Recognition** page to test the model with an image. Let‚Äôs work together towards healthier crops and a sustainable future! üöÄ
